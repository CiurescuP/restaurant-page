# restaurant-page
Restaurant Page fully responsive, mobile first. This was my second time working with Bootstrap, but this time I made a full page, not just some cards. I think that working with Bootstrap as a developer is really important because it make our jobs easier, and because it gives users that familiar feeling when visiting a website.
